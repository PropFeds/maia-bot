She realised, 'Cultural enlightenment my arse. It's all killing shanking, I can't get a peace to read my books.' That means she's not so dumb. She's quite an inquisitive being, and her purpose here was just to research the locals. She did side with the locals against her own kind, and later on established the Spire, an academy for the country. Her fellows are kinda dumb though, they were super aggressive and only wanted to assert dominance, that's why they invaded the civ in the first place. But after being trapped in the tropical jungles of Notnam <name needs development>, her fellows back in her city realised all the effects of aggression. Where they helped her build the Spire, a hilltop, looked just like a spiky wizard hat. To honour the Spire and its founder, the city was then renamed to Needlecap.",
